# dyndns-domeneshop
Simple DynDNS script using Domenshops API. Only works with python3

## python requirements
```
Install either from repo or with pip:
domeneshop, requests, configparser
```

## Usage
The initial version will only let you update one record at a time. Specify in settings.ini
It could probably be more failsafe and idiot proof as well...
