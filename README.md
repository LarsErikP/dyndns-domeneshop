# dyndns-domeneshop
Simple DynDNS script using Domenshops API. Only works with python3

## python requirements
```
Install either from repo or with pip:
domeneshop, requests, configparser
```

## Usage
The initial version will only let you update one record at a time. Specify in settings.ini
It could probably be more failsafe and idiot proof as well...

To use this, you need to contact Domeneshops customer service in order to activate API access for your account. It's very very beta..
